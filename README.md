# Death Gives Back
Death Gives Back is a mod made with BepInEx for use with the Potion Craft game. It gives you back the ingredients you lose when a potion fails.

Huge thanks to rswallen#6112 on the discord for helping me make it so it works through potion cancellation as well!

This is only compatible with v1.0.3.0 of the Potion Craft Game
